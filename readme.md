# Perfect and Amicable Numbers Finder

This Python script finds perfect and amicable numbers up to a specified limit.

## How It Works

- **Perfect Numbers**: A number is perfect if the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) equals the number.
- **Amicable Numbers**: Two distinct numbers \(a\) and \(b\) are considered amicable if the sum of the proper divisors of \(a\) equals \(b\) and vice versa.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x

### Running the Script

Save the script to a file (e.g., `main.py`) and execute it.

#### Default Limit (1500):

```sh
python3 main.py 2000
```

```sh
I am a Perfect number: 6, 6
I am a Perfect number: 28, 28
I am a friendship number: 220, 284
I am a Perfect number: 496, 496
I am a friendship number: 1184, 1210
```
